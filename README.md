## 🎮 Summary of The Gaming Room and Software Requirements  
The client, **The Gaming Room**, requested the design of a web-based application for their game *Draw It or Lose It*. The game already existed as an Android app, but they wanted to expand it into a **multi-platform environment** that supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile browsers.  

The new system needed to:
- Support **multiple concurrent games**, teams, and players  
- Ensure **unique names** for games and teams  
- Guarantee that only **one active instance** of the game service exists in memory  

The completed **Software Design Document** demonstrates the ability to analyze client requirements, structure system components, and communicate the design clearly for both the client and development team.

## 🧠 What I Did Well  
I did particularly well in creating a **clear and organized system architecture**, especially in explaining how each component interacts. The UML diagrams and class structure descriptions effectively communicated how the logic would manage players, teams, and sessions. I also provided strong **technology recommendations** that balanced scalability, efficiency, and maintainability.

## 🧩 Helpful Aspects of the Design Process  
Working through the design document helped me connect **requirements with code structure**. It encouraged deeper thinking about data handling, concurrency, and scalability before coding began. Planning out system relationships and dependencies made the eventual coding process smoother and more reliable.

## ✏️ Area for Improvement  
If I could revise one part of the project, I would improve the **network and security design** section. I would elaborate on encryption, authentication tokens, and secure API communication. Additionally, expanding on **cloud deployment options** would strengthen the design’s professional realism.

---

## 👥 Interpreting and Implementing User Needs  
I interpreted user needs by focusing on **usability, performance, and responsiveness**. The design ensures that multiple users can play simultaneously without conflicts. Understanding and implementing user needs is vital, as it keeps the software intuitive, enjoyable, and aligned with the client’s goals—ultimately leading to a better user experience and product success.

---

## 🧭 Approach to Software Design and Future Strategies  
My design approach was **modular and iterative**. I began with requirement analysis, built UML diagrams, defined classes, and outlined technical specifications. In future projects, I plan to integrate **Agile design principles**, rapid prototyping, and continuous user feedback early in development. I’ll continue using **GitHub for version control** and documentation to maintain transparency and collaboration.
